# Bean There Café - Website Documentation

##  Project Overview
Bean There Café is a fully responsive website designed for a fictional artisanal coffee shop. The website serves as a digital representation of the café, showcasing its offerings, sharing its story, and providing essential contact information. It embraces a clean and modern aesthetic that mirrors the café's commitment to quality, craftsmanship, and community.

##  Target Audience
This website is tailored for a variety of users. It caters to coffee enthusiasts searching for high-quality, artisanal experiences, and local residents looking for a cozy spot to work or meet friends. Tourists exploring the Genshinville area will find it helpful for discovering a local gem. Additionally, the website is designed to attract potential wholesale clients who may be interested in premium coffee beans, as well as job seekers looking to join the Bean There Café team.

##  Design Decisions

The visual identity of the website is rooted in a warm and welcoming color palette. Shades of brown, including #6F4E37 and #C4A484, were chosen to evoke the warmth and richness of coffee. Typography is a key element, with Playfair Display used for headings to convey elegance, and Open Sans used for body text to maintain readability. High-quality imagery of the café, its products, and staff contribute to an inviting digital presence. The layout is fully responsive, built with Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure smooth experiences across devices of all sizes.

On the technical side, the website was developed using Bootstrap 5 as its foundation. Custom CSS styles were layered over the framework to maintain a unique brand identity. JavaScript was kept lightweight, primarily used to handle form functionality and enhance UI elements. Font Awesome icons were integrated throughout the site to improve usability and aesthetics. The project is organized with separate HTML files for each section — Home, About, Menu, and Contact — ensuring maintainability and clarity in development.

User experience was a top priority. The navigation bar remains consistent across pages and includes visual cues to indicate the active section. Calls-to-action are prominent and direct users to essential actions, such as viewing the menu or contacting the café. The site loads quickly, thanks to image optimization and CDN-hosted resources. Accessibility features such as semantic HTML, proper color contrast, and ARIA attributes were thoughtfully implemented to make the site usable for everyone.

##  Key Features

The Home Page features a hero section with a headline and primary call-to-action button. It also includes a three-column layout that highlights the café’s unique selling points—quality beans, skilled baristas, and a relaxing atmosphere. The footer provides essential information, including location and operating hours, supported by an embedded Google Map.

The About Page shares the story behind Bean There Café, including details about the founders and the journey of building the brand. The café’s mission and values are presented through a series of icon-enhanced cards. Visitors can also learn more about the team members through photo bios, creating a personal and relatable connection.

The Menu Page is organized using a tabbed layout to separate categories such as Coffee, Tea, Food, and Seasonal offerings. Each item is displayed with a photo, description, and price. Coffee bean products are available for online browsing, with an “Add to Cart” button to hint at potential e-commerce capabilities.

The Contact Page includes a detailed form that allows users to select from multiple subject options when reaching out. Additional contact methods such as the physical address, phone number, and email are clearly displayed. A helpful FAQ section is included, using an accordion component for a clean and organized layout.

##  Challenges and Solutions

One of the initial challenges was designing a responsive navigation system that worked seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. This was addressed by utilizing Bootstrap’s navbar component and applying custom styles to ensure brand consistency across screen sizes. Organizing the menu content was another challenge; rather than overwhelming users with a long list, the menu was categorized into tabs for easier browsing. Maintaining visual hierarchy was also crucial — Bootstrap’s spacing utilities, along with custom typography styles, were employed to create a layout that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally clear. Lastly, for form validation, the project avoided complex JavaScript by leveraging HTML5 validation attributes, supported by custom styles to maintain visual consistency and usability.
